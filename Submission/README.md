This homework had 3 levels

**Level One - AssociateProfitSplitter contract**
- This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

**Level Two - TieredProfitSplitter contract**
- This will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

**Level Three - DeferredEquityPlan contract**
- This models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
